## My process
I used flexbox component to build the structure for mobile view, card components from Bootstrap 5 to build the rating and review sections and grid system from Bootstrap 5 to create two rows. Furthermore, I used @media for responsive design to switch between different background images.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5 Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Though the instruction were only for mobile and desktop view, I have created an extra view for tablet mode to create the responsive design. Through this, I learned how to implement the flexbox to align the container for responsive behaviour. Bootstrap 5 is also a handy tool when comes to create Grid system.



### Continued development

Through this learning process, I can confidently implement Flexbox and Grid system for future projects for responsive design.
